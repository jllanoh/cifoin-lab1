# Lab1 Waveguides

This repository contains notebooks to validate that the core dependencies for
the waveguides lab are installed and working. The intended workflow is VS Code
with a Linux environment (local or WSL).

## Prerequisites (Windows + WSL)

- Windows 10/11 with WSL 2 enabled.
- A Linux distribution installed via WSL (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).
- VS Code with the WSL extension installed.
- Python 3.10+ available inside WSL.

If you have not configured WSL yet, follow the official Microsoft setup guide and then open VS Code connected to WSL.

## Open the project

1. Open a terminal.
2. Fork the repo using GitHub Web.
3. Navigate to the repo folder (or clone it):
	- `git clone <your-repo-url>`
	- `cd cifoin-lab1`
4. Open the folder in VS Code.

## Create and select a Python environment

From the VS Code window:

1. Ensure `uv` is installed.
2. Sync dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:
	- `uv sync`
3. Select the interpreter in VS Code:
	- Command Palette -> Python: Select Interpreter -> choose the `.venv`
	  created by `uv` (if prompted).

## Install dependencies

Use the repo's `pyproject.toml` via `uv`:

```
uv sync
```

## Run the notebook

1. Open the notebook in VS Code:
	- `WAVEGUIDES_Student.ipynb`
2. Select the kernel named `cifoin-lab1` (or the `.venv` you created).
3. Run the cells top-to-bottom.

You should see the expected plots in the output cells.
